through the **Preferences** -> **Keyboard Shortcuts** menu.

My personal bindings for this plugin is displayed below as an example:

```JSON
    {
        "key": "ctrl+up",
        "command": "paragraphjump.up",
        "when": "textInputFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+down",
        "command": "paragraphjump.down",
        "when": "textInputFocus"
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+shift+down",
        "command": "paragraphjump.selectdown",
